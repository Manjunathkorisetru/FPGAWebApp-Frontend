# FPGAWebApp-Frontend

Master's thesis Manjunath Korisetru - You can access the Web App via https://fpgawebapp.netlify.app/

## Topic - FPGA-Database: Web Application for Interactive Visualization of FPGA Device specifications

In this thesis we have developed the FPGA Database: A comprehensive database consisting of FPGA devices and their specifications from various vendors and a FPGA Web Application: An application which enables the users to browse specifications of various FPGA devices, compare the specifications and visualize. 

## Steps to start the FPGA frontend web application
1. Once you are in the folder where you have saved the FPGAWebApp-Frontend. Try to run `node -v` to check if the npm is installed or not.
2. If npm is not installed, check this link on how to install node.js for windows:`https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows`
3. If npm is not installed, check this link on how to install node.js for Mac : `https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html`
4. Install dependencies by running the script `npm install`. This script will install all the dependencies mentioned in the file `package.json`.
5. After the dependencies are installed. Run `npm start`.
6. After running `npm start`, Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
7. If you do not see any data in the FPGA web application, You have to start the FPGA-Catalogue-backend first.
